# Enable GitHub Pages (site not showing)

The **gh-pages** branch already exists. You only need to turn on Pages in repo settings.

## Steps

1. **Open Pages settings (direct link)**  
   → **[https://github.com/akash-droid-dev/WYC_GMS_01/settings/pages](https://github.com/akash-droid-dev/WYC_GMS_01/settings/pages)**  
   (Log in to GitHub if asked.)

2. **Under "Build and deployment"**
   - **Source:** select **"Deploy from a branch"** (not "GitHub Actions").
   - **Branch:** open the dropdown → choose **"gh-pages"**.
   - **Folder:** choose **"/ (root)"**.
   - Click **Save**.

3. **Wait 1–2 minutes**, then open:  
   **https://akash-droid-dev.github.io/WYC_GMS_01/**

---

**If you don't see "Pages" in Settings**

- You must be an **owner** or **admin** of the repo. If you don’t see **Settings** or **Pages**, ask the repo owner to do the steps above or to give you admin access.

**If the link says "404"**

- After saving, wait 2–3 minutes and refresh.  
- Confirm the branch is **gh-pages** and the folder is **/ (root)**.
